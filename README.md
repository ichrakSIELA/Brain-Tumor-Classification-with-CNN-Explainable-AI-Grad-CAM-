# Brain-Tumor-Classification-with-CNN-Explainable-AI-Grad-CAM-
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for brain tumor detection/classification from MRI images, enhanced with Explainable AI (XAI) through Grad-CAM.
📌 Overview

This repository presents a deep learning–based approach for brain tumor detection and classification from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
The goal of the project is to automatically learn discriminative visual features from medical images in order to assist in the identification of brain tumors.

This work demonstrates how computer vision and deep learning techniques can be applied to medical image analysis, a critical domain where accuracy and robustness are essential.
